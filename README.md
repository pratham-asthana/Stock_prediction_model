# Stock_prediction_model
It is a project that predicts stock price and classifies whether to buy or sell a particular stock on a particular day.
I've imported 'quandl' in my project to have a dataset of shares/stocks, Quandl is a popular platform which provides economic, financial and alternative datasets.
KNN is a popular algorithm of supervised machine learning used in the model for both classification as well as regression. It classifies whether to sell or buy the stock on a date as classification and it predicts the values(price) of the stock based on it's past open,close,high and low values.
